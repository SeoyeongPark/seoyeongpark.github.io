A positive and passionate person graduated from Stony Brook University with strong background in computer science and statistics.  
Worked for Google Korea (via Vaco), Play Partnership team, and what I mainly did was leading consultation projects and manipulated/analyzed internal data.  

Prospectively, my first semester of Ph.D program in Computer Science will begin in Fall 2021 at NC State University.    
My interests settle in the application of data science, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to solving real-world problems, especially increasing accessibility and resolving inequality in technology.
