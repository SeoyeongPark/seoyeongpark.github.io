      <description>Project design The objective of this project is to help students design and simulate their course schedules based on given the dataset of the course listing.
The course scheduler is considered as a constraint satisfaction problem by checking schedule conflicts and requirements to generate a feasible schedule with minimizing unsatisfied preference. We have assumed that every student must enroll as a full-time student, and they have a maximum credit limit. Each course contains information about time, prerequisites, instructor, and more.</description>
