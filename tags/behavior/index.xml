      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding customers and segmenting in an appropriate way play a vital role in business operations and effective marketing strategies. It helps target specific customer groups for increased engagement and profit. However, traditional approaches often struggle to predict future purchase patterns, especially when user data is sparse and fragmented across multiple sources. This research proposes a novel clustering-based multitask classification method to address these limitations. We integrated the Recency, Frequency Monetary (RFM) model to cluster customers based on their purchase patterns from various purchase categories (tickets, merchandise, fan club membership) to create a more comprehensive understanding of loyalty for a professional basketball team in Japan. The proposed model predicts a customer&amp;rsquo;s segment across all purchase categories, implying the potential relationships between each category. Initial results demonstrate that the model effectively analyzes purchase behaviors, offering actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Influencing behavior change: adaptive interventions using cognitive mechanism</title>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;summary-and-goal&#34;&gt;Summary and goal&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TBC&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do people choose actions? Understanding the complexity of the human mind has been a persistent challenge in recent studies. How people choose actions is a complex and multifaceted task in the field of human behavior modeling. This challenge arises from the inherent complexity and diversity of human cognition, which is influenced by a lot of factors, including individual differences, environmental contexts, and the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identifying Barriers Faced by Older Adults in Mobile App Usage</title>
      <link>https://seoyeongpark.github.io/research/elderly-accessibility/</link>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As life expectancy increases and the elderly population grows, the older adults&amp;rsquo; embrace of technology is highlighted in modern society as one of the key factors in closing the digital gap to prevent discrimination among different age groups. In this paper, we explore the psychological and technological factors that influence mobile usage by older users. In addition, we describe our observation about the supplement points of the present accessibility guidelines for older adults to embed them into the mobile environment to improve their independence and quality of life. In brief, aging-specific factors classified into four categories (physical, cognition, perception, and motivation) are passively reflected in the existing accessibility guidelines. Rather the guidelines emphasize a narrow range of physical impairments and rely on device-built-in assistive tools. Since this phenomenon undermines older adults&amp;rsquo; willingness to technology adoption which led to the digital divide and ageism, we state the necessity for research in accessibility and aging users collaborating with AI to develop new design guidelines improved with aging and cognitive aspects to lower the technology barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
