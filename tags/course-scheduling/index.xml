      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-design&#34;&gt;Project design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to help students design and simulate their course schedules based on given the dataset of the course listing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The course scheduler is considered as a constraint satisfaction problem by checking schedule conflicts and requirements to generate a feasible schedule with minimizing unsatisfied preference. We have assumed that every student must enroll as a full-time student, and they have a maximum credit limit. Each course contains information about time, prerequisites, instructor, and more. Each student has a profile of courses they took, degree requirements, level of degree, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
